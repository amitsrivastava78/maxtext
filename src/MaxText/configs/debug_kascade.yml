# Tiny Llama config for CPU development and Kascade attention testing

# We inherit from the base configuration

# --- Model Architecture (Tiny Version) ---
# A standard Llama has 32 layers. We use 2.
# A standard Llama has 4096 dim. We use 64.
per_device_batch_size: 1
max_target_length: 64       # Short sequence length for fast debugging

# --- Execution Settings ---
# We use "iota_embed" which generates fake embeddings mathematically.
# This means we don't even need to download a tokenizer file!

steps: 3                    # Run for 3 steps then stop
enable_checkpointing: False # Don't save heavy files
decoder_block: "llama2"     # Use the Llama architecture logic
dataset_type: "synthetic"   # Use synthetic data for testing
attention: "dot_product"    # Use simple dot product attention for CPU

# Optimizer settings
